            This is the first post on my website. I made this website to host anything that I want to publish.
            My number one goal is to write about things that atleast one person somewhere might find useful.
            Solutions to problems that I have encountered, guides on languages/frameworks or just something cool I want to share.
        </p>
        <h3>The website</h3>
        <p>
            When designing this site I had to decide which framework to use. My prevous webstite was build using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>.
            This is the most popular static site generator, so why not use it?
        </p>
        <p>
            A blog is a very simple website. There are no moving parts or live updates, just simple text and images.
            You don’t even need to update it that often. So why would you need hundreds of configs to render some simple HTML?
            I’d rather spend my time writing blog posts.
        </p>
        <p>
            One alternative that really caught my attention was <a href="https://plainvanillaweb.com/">Plain Vanila Web</a>.
            It’s not a website generator, it’s just a static website, no dependencies and build steps needed.
            And it’s powered by modern web standarts (such as <i>Web Components</i>).
        </p>
        <p>
            For development I use <i>VS Code</i> with <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server">Live Preview</a> plugin.
            One thing I immediately noticed was how fast development loop is.
            You can open html in <i>Live Preview</i> and immediately see your changes.
        </p>
        <p>    
            The build step is integrated in the browser! For the new post I need to go to <a href="../generator.html">/blog/generator.html</a> and generate new <a href="../feed.xml">RSS Atom feed</a> and <a href="../index.json">Blog index</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Deployment</h3>
        <p>
            Since the website has no build step it’s really easy to do a deployment.
            I'm using Cloudflare Pages for hosting. Previously my Hugo blog required build step in <a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Pages</a>.
            Currently, the workflow takes ten seconds to build and deploy to the server!
